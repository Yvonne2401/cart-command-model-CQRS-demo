Demo explaining CQRS by using Axon
# CQRS-command-model-demo

This is an example how you could build a command side webapp using:

  - Springboot
  - Maven
  - AxonFramework
  - AxonServer (external jar or in Docker)
  - WireSpec to generate the endpoints


This is an example the command model of an Ecommerce checkout service.

The aggregate is the Shopping(Cart) with the following events:

| Event                      | Description                                                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CartCreated                | a new Cart Aggregate was created                                    |
| ItemAddedToCart            | a certain amount of products were added                             |
| ItemRemovedFromCart        | a certain product was removed                                       |
| TotalAmountRecalculated    | the total amount of the cart was changed while handling the command |
| ItemQuantityAdjustedInCart | the number ordered for a product has been changed                   |
| PriceOfItemInCartAdjusted  | the price of a product has changed                                  |
| PaymentReceived            | a payment has been done                                             |
| OrderCreated               | the order has been paid and created                                 |

The goal is to map the incoming requests from REST endpoints into commands. In the Aggregate the commands will be handled in command handles in which the business logic is implemented
